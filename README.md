# Changes #
Made it easier to annotate documents using non-ascii characters, such as λ,α,γ,δ,μ, which are commonly used in Maths and the Sciences. 

Latex like syntax is used. So to write λ, you would write \lambda. When you finish writing the text, these are processed and converted into the appropriate unicode characters. It works with the with the most of the LaTeX macros for common math symbols and their unicode equivalent characters given in http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/unicode-math/

The project can also be easily extented to work with custom macros by adding these in the patterns.txt file.
