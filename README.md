# Changes #
Added support for annotating using non-ascii characters in Xournal, such as λ,α,γ,δ,μ which are commonly used in Maths and the Sciences. 

Latex like syntax is used. So to write λ, you would write \lambda. When you finish writing the text, these are processed and converted into the appropriate unicode characters. A limited set of of such characters are added for now, but support can easily be extended to other characters by extending the patterns.txt file.
